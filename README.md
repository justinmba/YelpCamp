# YelpCamp


This is my first real web application. It's the culmination of about 100 hours and is built from scratch. It contains all of the basic html, javascript, css, and etc., written in NodeJS. It also contains authentication, authorization, linked external databases, and cool pictures of campsites.

It focuses on RESTful routing, being as dry as possible. The attached package.json shows all of the dependencies needed, but focuses primarily express. This was built in goormIDE and used Mongoose as a web server, and it's deployed through heroku.
